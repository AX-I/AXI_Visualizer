Hierarchical Tiled Scanline Rasterization

Step 1: Triangle setup - projection, culling, clipping. Atomic insert triangle indexes by block.

Step 2: Gather - compact triangle indexes. Partition triangles into big and small.

Step 3: Early rasterization - small triangles are directly rasterized.

Step 4: Coarse rasterization - large triangles: rasterize indexes into n-index buffer per tile. This may entail use of LOD for larger scenes.

Step 5: Fine rasterization - 1 block per tile, 1 thread per triangle in a tile.  Local z-buffer and index-access buffer, if multiple accesses then use local thread index to sequentially determine min depth.

Step 6/0: Clear buffers.
