# AXI_Visualizer

AXI Visualizer is a complete software 3D graphics pipeline and engine written with Python and OpenCL.

It uses scanline rasterization kernels which can be run on the CPU or the GPU compute units.

Currently the engine is used in AXI Animator, a simple and accessible rigging / skinning / posing tool.
