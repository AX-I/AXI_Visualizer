# AXI Visualizer

AXI Visualizer is a complete software 3D graphics pipeline and engine written with Python and OpenCL.

It uses scanline rasterization kernels which can be run on the CPU or the GPU compute units.

See a [full feature list](http://axi.rf.gd/Visualizer/Features.html) with some demo clips.

Main dependencies are Numpy, Numexpr, PIL, and PyOpenCL.

Currently the engine is used in AXI Animator, a simple and accessible rigging / skinning / posing tool.

'AXI_Visualizer.py' can also be directly run.
